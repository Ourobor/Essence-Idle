This is just a file to organize my thoughts.
I make no promises about anything contained here.
These are fleeting ideas that can cease to exist at a whim.

# Todo for next Build:
## Contacts
- [ ] Have concrete contact keys be accessable as a static constant like thing
- [ ] Implement some kind of Read vs Unread system for stages so that unread stuff can be telegraphed to the player
## Items
- [ ] Add Item tab
## Rituals
- [ ] Add Ritual tab
- [ ] Add Essence Coin creation ritual


# Future Ideas
## General
- [ ] Divination(card based gameplay??)
## Contacts
## Items
## Rituals
- [ ] ?????????
