This is just a file to organize my thoughts.
I make no promises about anything contained here.
These are fleeting ideas that can cease to exist at a whim.

# Todo for next Build:
## Contacts
- [x] Implement a better solution for reading current stage such that it's more flaglike
  - Flags companion object in MainActivityViewModel
- [x] Save Contact State
- [ ] Lock Soul Forge behind Watchful Raven

# Future Ideas
## Contacts
- [ ] Have concrete contact keys be accessable as a static constant like thing
- [ ] Implement some kind of Read vs Unread system for stages so that unread stuff can be telegraphed to the player
## Rituals
- [ ] Add Ritual tab
- [ ] ?????????
