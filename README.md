# Essence-Idle

Essence Idle is two things: a silly little idle game I felt like making to fiddle around with in my spare time and also an excuse to brush off rust and learn how to write android apps. The intent is to (optionally) tie the game into as many android systems as I can in order to have an excuse to learn how to work with them. This is also why I didn't use anything like Godot or an actual game framework. The game aspect is simply there to give me an excuse and also give me the dopamine to work on it.

# Features
- [x] A queue based idle system rewarding planning over mashing a button over and over again until you buy an upgrade that invalidates mashing that button
- [ ] A non-linear progression system that allows for personal expression and strategy
- [ ] Integration into all sorts of android technology for bonuses, with those integrations being purely optional for the user. 

## *Tentitive* Plans
These are thoughts I've had but haven't looked into enough to actually plan. There are no guarentees at all if they'll get added or how they'll end up being implemented. 

- [ ] Scanning barcodes for something
- [ ] Rewarding good sleep schedules by tapping into android's sleep tracking thingies. If possible. Did I mention I haven't looked into these ideas yet?
- [ ] Rewarding physical activity or whatever through android's fitness stuff
- [ ] Geolocation stuff? Maybe? Could be fun.


# Contributions
This is a personal portfolio project at the moment and I'm not really looking to make this for anyone other than myself. Honestly, I will be extremely surprised if anyone actually wants to contribute to some random nothing project but if there's actually someone reading this who wants to, reach out to me I guess. I'll see what I can do.
